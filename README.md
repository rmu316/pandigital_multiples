# pandigital_multiples

#About
Project Euler #38: Find the largest 1 to 9 pandigital 9-digit number that can be formed as the concatenated product of an integer with (1,2, ... , n) where n > 1. A concatenated product of an integer w/ 1, 2, 3, ... n is that which is constructed by the product of the int w/ 1, 2, 3, ... concantenated w/ each other. Ex. 192384576 is the concatenated product of 9 and 192 and 1, 2, 3 since 192 = 192 x 1, 384 = 192 x 2, 576 = 192 x 3 and these products have been concatenated together.
